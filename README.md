# Starcraft (A player for MIT Battlecode 2018)

In order to use the player, clone this repository into the scaffold folder.  To pit different versions of this player against itself, clone different branches of the repository into separate folders in the scaffold.


### Eclipse Integration

If you're using Sublime then you do you, but to use Eclipse, initialize your workspace in the `\bc18-scaffold` folder and create the new java project with the same name as the player folder name, which by default should be `\Starcraft`.  Then everything should fall into place properly.
